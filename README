|    What is Outor?                                                                                                   |

|    Outor is a terminal-based ultimate outfit advisor and temperature converter made for fun. It's intended to be    |
|    used in situations where advise is needed on what to wear during specific weather conditions.                    |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    How to use it?                                                                                                   |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    To use this program, proceed to the following platform-specific instructions:                                    |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    * GNU/Linux: invoke a terminal or a terminal emulator and navigate your way to the executable. When in the same  |
|    directory as the executable, check out whether it's marked as an executable program. To run it, execute the      |
|    following command: `./Outor-<version>-<platform>.AppImage`. Then, press any key which corresponds to one of the  |
|    main menu options (look at the leading letters for a hint). Follow the instructions given on the screen;         |
|    * Windows: double-click on the executable and wait for the command prompt to appear on the screen. Then, press   |
|    any key which corresponds to one of the main menu options (look at the leading letters for a hint). Follow the   |
|    instructions given on the screen.                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    Compilation                                                                                                      |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    If you are interested in building the packages yourself, you can do so freely at any given time. The project     |
|    uses CMake for building purposes, for easier access to compiler tools and options.                               |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    Ensure that you have all of the necessary packages to build the packages:                                        |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    * CMake >= 3.18.4;                                                                                               |
|    * make >= 4.3;                                                                                                   |
|    * ncurses >= 6.2.                                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    To install those packages on GNU/Linux distributions, see the                                                    |
|    following:                                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    * Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install build-essential cmake libncurses-dev`;                                             |
|    * Fedora: `dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries" && dnf install cmake ncurses-devel`.             |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    The following instructions are applicable only to the GNU/Linux platform. Keep that in mind for the remainder of |
|    this chapter.                                                                                                    |
|                                                                                                                     |
|    To build a package, create a dedicated build directory that will host all of the building-related configurations.|
|    Move to the aforementioned directory and execute the following command: `cmake ..`. If all of the requirements   |
|    are fulfilled, you should be able to begin the compilation process by executing `make` command in the build      |
|	 directory. The binary files should appear shortly in the current directory after issuing the previous command.   |
|                                                                                                                     |
